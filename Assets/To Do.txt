To Do References:
TimerUiController.cs
- Replace Input logic with new Input System
- Remove ownership of the timer from the Ui controller and give it to the GameplaySession.cs
SrsUiController.cs
- Split views into their own scripts and make this script the navigation controller.
- Replace instantiation and destroy logic with an object pool.
- Implement limits in the views (other than overview which already has it) to prevent overflow and implement pagination.
- Change streak label between "Success/Failure Streak" based on the value of data.lastResult.

General List: (in order of priority)

Node Editor:
- Separate NodeEditorUiController feature ownership into smaller and easily digestible scripts
- Add robust error handling
- Refactor spawn point logic
- Figure a way to utilize and show readable names for entrance ids
- - Look into implementing slugs if there isn't an easy workaround with the current structure
- - Investigate all possible use cases for readable def strings in the current project
- Implement visit order
- - Refer to nodes by index in code but display node name in Ui
- Restrict the node editor to the Unity Editor
- Assess what is required to add user generated content and make the node editor useable at runtime in a build

Triggers:
- Add node detection as part of the player collision logic in order to fire events when in a given radius of a node
- Add interaction input which can be triggered when in the radius of a node

Checkpoints:
- Add Ui which replicates the in game Ui for checkpoint teleportation
- Implement logic to allow users to teleport from and to any visited checkpoint

Spaced Repetition System:
- Learning center Ui
- - Burned Window
- - All Window
- - Show/Hide entries
- - Play random due entry

Layout Browser:
- Area Buttons Ui Prefab
- Graph Buttons Ui Prefab
- Layout Buttons Ui Prefab

Collisions:
- Once CivilianLP's tool is ready, implement play collisions
- Add collision boolean to player settings to make collisions optional
- Modify fog shader to only apply edge colour to the walkable grid cells of the collision map

Player Path:
- Calculate the distance traveled of the player from time start to time end
- Display traveled distance in real time
- Display traveled path when prompted by the player

User Generated Content:
- Update ContentService to allow loading local layouts from the persistent data path
- Utilize Asset database structure to build paths for user imported screenshots
- - Use Ids as folder names E.g. act_1 -> .../act_1/
- - Use Persistent Data Path for user imported layouts (Read/Write) instead of Streaming Assets
- Modify the node editor to enable runtime use outside of the editor for user generated content
- - Save data to a serialized object (same structure as the scriptable object) when using the node editor at runtime

Content Service:
- Implement asset caching to avoid redownloading and reloading the same assets
- Investigate local persistent caching

Project:
- Ship app with a layout for each graph

Inputs
- Switch to new input system
- Review old input code
- - Replace with new input system logic
- - Move to different scripts if necessary

Data Persistence:
- Layout Params File
- - Layout Params Service

Layout Parameters:
- Load parameters on startup
- Display name
- - Update learning center and layout browser names based on layout params
- Filtering
- - Implement Ui and logic for filtering layouts based on their custom flags
- Params settings menu
- - Create settings Ui for modifying a target layout's parameters
- - Save on apply
- - Open the menu upon selecting a layout in the layout nav window of the layout browser
